# Indian Sign Language Recognition System

## 📖 Introduction
This project presents a **computer vision and deep learning–based Indian Sign Language (ISL) Recognition System** that detects hand gestures using a webcam and recognizes **alphabets (A–Z) and digits (1–9)**.  
The system also converts recognized signs into **voice output**, enabling better communication between hearing-impaired users and non–sign-language users.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Communication between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public is often challenging due to limited understanding of sign language.  
This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a real-time system that recognizes Indian Sign Language gestures and converts them into readable text and speech.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To recognize Indian Sign Language alphabets (A–Z) and digits (1–9).
- To detect both one-hand and two-hand gestures using MediaPipe and CVZone.
- To apply deep learning techniques for accurate gesture classification.
- To generate voice output for the recognized signs.
- To provide a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **CVZone**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Streamlit**
- **gTTS / pyttsx3**

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 2: Run the application
bash
streamlit run app.py


**📊 Output**
1. Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam.
2. Recognition of ISL alphabets and digits.
3. Display of recognized sign on the screen.
4. Audio output of the detected gesture.

**⚠️ Limitations**
- Requires proper lighting conditions.
- Accuracy may decrease with complex backgrounds.
- Limited to predefined alphabets and digits.

**🚀 Future Enhancements**
. Recognition of full words and sentences.
. Support for dynamic gestures.
. Mobile application implementation.
. Improved accuracy using advanced deep learning models.
